# LeetCode Practice Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! 🚀

This repo is a personal archive of solutions to coding problems I've tackled on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each folder is organized by algorithmic technique, making it easy to browse and revisit solutions as I continue my journey to master data structures and algorithms.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **stack/**  
  Solutions using stack-based approaches.
  - `hard-largestRectangleArea.py`: Find the largest rectangle in a histogram.

- **two_pointer/**  
  Problems solved with the two-pointer technique.
  - `11-med-maxArea.py`: Container With Most Water.
  - `15-med-3Sum.py`: Find all unique triplets that sum to zero.
  - `42-hard-TrappingRainWater.py`: Calculate trapped rainwater.
  - `easy-isPalindrome.py`: Check if a string is a palindrome (ignoring non-alphanumerics).
  - `med-twoSum.py`: Find two numbers that add up to a target.

## 📝 How I Use This Repo

- Save and organize solutions for future reference.
- Track progress and revisit tricky problems.
- Experiment with different approaches and optimizations.

## 💡 Why Practice LeetCode?

Practicing LeetCode problems helps sharpen problem-solving skills, prepares for technical interviews, and deepens understanding of computer science fundamentals.
